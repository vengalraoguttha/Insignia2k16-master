Insignia is a literature festival, spanning two days. The events being held can be classified into three categories, namely, Quizzing, Debating and Writing, interspersed with a gamut of enjoyable recreational activities. The quizzes will pose a considerable challenge to those who wish to display their mental prowess. Their minds will be titillated by the impassioned debates on myriad of societal issues. And the story tellers shall grip their pens tighter when their creativity rises to its zenith. This literary festival aspires to ascend to the pinnacles of quality, and attract more individuals to bring their unique persona to the smorgasbord of minds.",

Alphaz is the debating and literary society of National Institute of Technology, Delhi. It was founded with the primary objective of creating a dimension of unorthodox learning. The events, conducted by Alphaz, train its participants to think clearly, argue coherently, and speak forcefully on any topic. Alphaz has continually endeavoured to provide our college with an unparalleled source for the oratorical and literary improvement. Yet the society has never been simply a student organization, and its influence and bonds of friendship formed survives long after the culmination of a studentâ€™s life. Alphaz faces the future confident in its traditions but cognizant of the need for innovation.",R.drawable.image2));
